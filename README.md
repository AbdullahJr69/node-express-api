# node-express-api
A Simple yet effective API to get understanding of how API's work. </Br>
Oi, How you doing?
This is an API, a rather simple one actually, built on basic NodeJS and Express framework.
Try to study the API and mess with it to see and understand how APIs work.
One thing to know before putting tests to this API is to get to know that this API uses mongoDB to
store data on the cloud. So making a MongoDB account and carefully adding the connection code to <i>app.js</i> is necessary to be able to use that functionality.
In my case, the password to mongoDB cloud clusters is a variable in a .env file accessed through dot-env.
Hope you have fun.
Happy coding!
